# Covid-19
Hey guys,
I wanted to share with you the insights which I've discovered during my Covid-19 research(EDA is still going on)
The parameters that I've used are total confirmed cases, number of new cases every day , day of outbreak and Recovery rate.
Day of Outbreak - This parameter is used to maintain the consistency so that it is easier to compare two countries. the count of day of outbreak starts when country exceeds a total of 300 cases.
Recovery rate - Recovered patients in terms of %age.
